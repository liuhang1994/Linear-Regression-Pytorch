# Deep Learning with Pytorch
### This repository will be about how to make deep learning project with pytorch. It includes following topics:
#### 1. Tensors and some useful functions in pytorch
#### 2. Linear regression 
#### 3. Classification by fully connected neural networks
#### 4. Image classification by CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks)
#### 5. Deep Reinforcement Learning (Playing atari games)  
#### I try to edit and complete all of this topics as soon as I can.
